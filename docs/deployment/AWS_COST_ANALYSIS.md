# 💰 AWS COST TRUTH: "EASY" vs. "FREE"
**"The Price of Comfort"**

You asked: *"Do I need to pay money for AWS?"*

### 🚨 THE TRUTH: YOU MUST CHOOSE ONE.
AWS has two paths. You cannot have both.

---

## PATH A: THE "EASY" WAY (No Linux) 🧘‍♂️
**Services:** AWS App Runner + AWS RDS (Managed).
**Cost:** **~$15 - $25 / month.**
*   **Why pay?** You are paying AWS to manage the Linux servers for you.
*   **Pros:** You click buttons. It just works.
*   **Cons:** You pay money immediately.

## PATH B: THE "FREE" WAY (Hard Mode) 🏋️‍♂️
**Services:** AWS EC2 (t2.micro) + Self-Managed Postgres.
**Cost:** **$0 / month** (For 12 Months).
*   **Why free?** AWS gives you a distinct "Free Tier" for 1 year, but YOU must do the work.
*   **Pros:** Totally free for 1 year.
*   **Cons:** You must use Linux Commands (`ssh`, `sudo`, `docker`). If it breaks, YOU fix it.

## 🏆 MY RECOMMENDATION
**If you are a King (Business Owner):**
Pay the **$15/month** for **Path A**.
Your time is worth more than $15. Trying to save money by learning Linux will cost you weeks of frustration.

**If you are a Student:**
Choose **Path B** and learn Linux. It is free.

**Which one are you?** 🔱
