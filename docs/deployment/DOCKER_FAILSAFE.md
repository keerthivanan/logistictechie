# 🐳 IS DOCKER NEEDED? (THE TRUTH)
**"The Box vs. The Mover"**

You asked: *"Is Docker needed for my website?"*

### 🟢 THE SHORT ANSWER: NO.
**(Because you chose AWS App Runner).**

---

## 🧠 WHY? (The Analogy)
*   **Docker** is like packing your furniture into a **Box** yourself.
*   **AWS App Runner** is a **Moving Company** that packs the box *for* you.

### 🛑 WHEN IS DOCKER NEEDED?
You **ONLY** need Docker if:
1.  You are using a cheap VPS (DigitalOcean $5 server).
2.  You have complex dependencies (like custom video processing tools).

### ✅ WITH AWS APP RUNNER (Your Choice)
1.  You give AWS your **Python Code**.
2.  AWS says: *"Ah, this is Python. I will build the container for you."*
3.  **You do zero work.**

---

## 🏆 YOUR STRATEGY
**Do not learn Docker right now.**
It adds complexity you don't need yet.
Stick to the **AWS Execution Plan**. Use "Source Code" mode. Let AWS handle the heavy lifting.

**You are the King. You delegate the packing.** 🔱
