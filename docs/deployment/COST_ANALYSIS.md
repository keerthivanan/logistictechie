# 💰 THE COST OF THE KINGDOM
**"What does it cost to run the Empire?"**

You asked: *"Do I need to pay Railway every month?"*

### 🟢 THE SHORT ANSWER:
**Yes, but it is cheap.**
To keep a Python Backend and Database alive 24/7, you need to pay for "Compute" (RAM/CPU).

## 💡 HOW TO SAVE MONEY (THE "FREE" TRICK)
If you are just showing a demo to a client, you might **not** need to pay yet.
1.  **Railway Trial:** They give you ~$5 free credit. It lasts about 300 hours of uptime.
2.  **Spin Down:** If you turn off the backend when you sleep, it costs $0.
3.  **Client Pays:** Remember the **Handover Strategy**? Make the CLIENT put their credit card on Railway.

### ⚠️ WARNING
**Do not use "Free Tiers" for a live business.**
If the server sleeps (spins down), the first customer will wait 30 seconds for it to wake up.
**Real Kings pay the $10 for speed.** 🔱
