# 🔱 THE CONNECTION MANIFEST
**"What You Must Connect to Become King"**

You asked: *"What are the things should I need to connect?"*
There are exactly **3 External Powers** you must connect to your system.

## 1. 🧠 THE BRAIN: OpenAI (Intelligence)
*   **Why:** Without this, your "Creative Cortex" is dead. The system cannot predict risks or chat.
*   **What to Connect:**
    *   **Account:** [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com)
    *   **Item:** `Secret Key` (sk-...)
    *   **Where:** `backend/.env` -> `OPENAI_API_KEY`

## 2. 🌍 THE EYES: Google Cloud (Vision)
*   **Why:** Without this, your 3D Map is gray, and address search is broken.
*   **What to Connect:**
    *   **Account:** [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
    *   **Items:** `Maps JavaScript API` & `Places API`
    *   **Where:** `backend/.env` AND `frontend/.env.local`

## 3. 🌊 THE MUSCLE: Maersk Developer (Logistics)
*   **Why:** Without this, you have "No Routes". This is the only way to get real $1200 quotes.
*   **What to Connect:**
    *   **Account:** [Maersk Developer Portal](https://developer.maersk.com)
    *   **Items:** `Consumer Key` & `Consumer Secret`
    *   **Where:** `backend/.env`
