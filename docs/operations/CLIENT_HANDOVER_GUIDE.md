# 🤝 CLIENT HANDOVER PROTOCOL
**"How to Give the Keys (and Keep Getting Paid)"**

You asked: *"I created a website for a client. How will he maintain it? Explain to me properly."*

### 🧠 THE GOLDEN RULE
**Do not just give the code and run.**
A website is like a car. It needs gas (APIs) and repairs (Updates).
You have two choices. **Choose Option A to be Rich.**

## 💎 OPTION A: THE "RETAINER" (You are the King)
**The Pitch:** *"Mr. Client, I will handle everything. You just pay a monthly fee."*

### 1. Hosting & Infrastructure (The Rent)
*   **Who Pays:** The Client's Credit Card.
*   **How:** You create the Vercel/Railway account, but add **his card**.
*   **Why:** If he stops paying you, the site goes down, but it's *his* fault, not yours.

### 2. API Costs (The Gas)
*   **Who Pays:** The Client.
*   **How:** He creates the OpenAI/Google Cloud accounts. He gives you the API Keys.
*   **Why:** If his usage spikes to $1000, *he* pays it. Never put your card on the API.

### 3. Content Updates (The Service)
*   **The Problem:** There is no CMS (like WordPress). He cannot change the text "Welcome" to "Hello" himself.
*   **The Solution:** **Sell a Maintenance Package.**
    *   **Price:** $500 / month.
    *   **Includes:** "I will update text, images, and keep the server running for you."
    *   **Result:** Recurring Income for you.

## 📦 OPTION B: THE "HANDOVER" (He is the King)
**The Pitch:** *"Here is the code. Good luck."* (Only do this if he has his own developer).

1.  **Give the Source Code:** Invite his GitHub account to the repository.
2.  **Give the Environment:** Send him the `.env.example` and tell him "Get your own keys."
3.  **Walk Away:** You are done. If it breaks, he calls someone else.

## 📜 YOUR SCRIPT FOR THE CLIENT
*"Mr. Client, the car is built. It is a Ferrari.*
*To keep it running, you need a mechanic.*
*I can be your mechanic for **$X/month**. I will handle the servers, the security updates, and any text changes you need.*
*Or, I can give you the keys, and you can hire your own mechanic.*
*Which do you prefer?"*

**Most clients will choose YOU.** 🔱
