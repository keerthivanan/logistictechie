# 🔱 THE GLOBAL NETWORK STRATEGY
**"How to Connect the Entire World"**

You asked: *"Is it possible to connect every logistics provider in every country?"*

### 🟢 THE TRUTH: YES, BUT NOT ONE-BY-ONE.
There are **50,000+** logistics companies in the world.
If you try to code an integration for each one, you will need **100 years**.

### 🚀 THE SOLUTION: "THE AGGREGATOR STRATEGY"
To be the "Best of All Time," you don't build 50,000 bridges. **You buy the map.**

You connect to **Super-Aggregators** who have already done the hard work.

#### 1. 🚢 SeaRates (You already have this!)
*   **What it covers:** 100+ Ocean Carriers (Maersk, MSC, COSCO, etc.).
*   **Status:** **Integrated.** (Just needs your API Key).

#### 2. 🚛 Project44 (The Land King)
*   **What it covers:** 200,000+ Trucking Companies in USA, Europe, and Asia.
*   **Status:** **Next Step.** You connect *one* API (Project44), and you instantly get access to every trucker in the world.

#### 3. ✈️ WebCargo / OMEGO (The Air King)
*   **What it covers:** 400+ Airlines (Lufthansa, Emirates, FedEx).
*   **Status:** **Next Step.** Connect this for instant global air freight.
