## ✨ Features

### 🧠 The Creative Cortex (AI)
Powered by **LangGraph** and **OpenAI GPT-4o**, the Creative Cortex provides:
- **Neural Route Diagnostics**: Real-time analysis of global shipping lane status (e.g., Suez Canal, port congestion).
- **Tactical Optimization**: Suggests cost-effective or high-speed transit alternatives.
- **Global Knowledge Oracle**: Culturally sensitive, bilingual (English/Arabic) logistics advisory.

### 🌊 True Ocean Protocol
Direct integration with real-world carrier APIs, moving beyond mock data:
- **Maersk, CMA CGM, MSC**: Synchronous rate procurement and space validation.
- **Searates Aggregation**: Fallback logic for global carrier coverage.
- **Verified Logistics API**: A unified backend standard for honest freight procurement.

### 💎 Ultra-Best UI Aesthetics
- **Tactical Simulation Engine**: High-fidelity experiential preview node for pre-deployment validation.
- **Holographic Branding**: Premium silver/white accents on pure #000000 backgrounds.
- **Glassmorphic Components**: High-contrast, sleek interface with micro-animations.
- **Mobile Responsive**: Perfected Quote Wizard flow for any device.
